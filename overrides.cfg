############################################# \
######## USER CONFIG OVERRIDES FILE #########  + --> This will help you personalize my config to your printer :)
############################################# /

# This file is yours! Feel free to edit it in order to include all the needed
# things to adapt my generic config to your machine. This file will not be erased
# when updating the config using moonraker and it will be kept as you've set it.
# You can change every section of the config. You can also add some new custom macros, etc...
# The corresponding documentation can be found in: docs > overrides.md

### Also, keep in mind: if you use a multi-MCU config such as the old school double SKRs or a CANbus toolhead
### board, you will need to specify which components are connected to which board in your own mcu.cfg file!
### Example: if something is connected to the toolhead MCU, you should use "config_pin: toolhead:PIN_NAME".

#> Main control MCUs are called "mcu" (and "secondary" when using a double MCU configuration)
#> Toolhead CANboard MCUs are called "toolhead"
#> ERCF MCUs are called "ercf"

#   START_PRINT SEQUENCE  #
#-------------------------#

## The START_PRINT sequence is modular and fully customizable. A default START_PRINT sequence is auto-populated based on
## your probe choice (TAP, Dockable, Inductive), but if for some reasons you still want to modify it, please uncomment the following 3
## lines to define a new `variable_startprint_actions`. You can use any number of action or even duplicate some actions if needed.
## Available actions: "bed_soak", "extruder_preheating", "chamber_soak", "extruder_heating", "tilt_calib", "z_offset", "bedmesh", "purge", "purge", "primeline"
##
# [gcode_macro _USER_VARIABLES]
#variable_startprint_actions: "extruder_preheating", "purge", "clean"
# gcode: # do not remove this line


#-------------------------#
#   EXTRUDER/BED PIDs     #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the PIDs. I put them here as almost everyone will use them,
## so just uncomment the following lines and change the values according to your own machine
#[heater_bed]
#max_power: 0.75


#-------------------------#
#   Z MOTORS DIRECTION    #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the motor directions as it's a pretty common one. If you need
## to invert the Z1 or Z3 motor direction on your machine, just uncomment the following lines.

[extruder]
step_pin: E_STEP
dir_pin: !E_DIR
enable_pin: !E_ENABLE
rotation_distance: 22.7038979
pressure_advance: 0.032
pressure_advance_smooth_time: 0.020

[stepper_x]
step_pin: X_STEP
dir_pin: !X_DIR
enable_pin: !X_ENABLE

[tmc2209 stepper_x]

[stepper_y]
step_pin: Y_STEP
dir_pin: !Y_DIR
enable_pin: !Y_ENABLE

[tmc2209 stepper_y]

[stepper_z]
step_pin: Z_STEP
dir_pin: !Z_DIR
enable_pin: !Z_ENABLE
position_endstop: -0.245

[stepper_z1]
step_pin: Z1_STEP
dir_pin: Z1_DIR
enable_pin: !Z1_ENABLE

[stepper_z2]
step_pin: Z2_STEP
dir_pin: !Z2_DIR
enable_pin: !Z2_ENABLE

[stepper_z3]
step_pin: Z3_STEP
dir_pin: Z3_DIR
enable_pin: !Z3_ENABLE


#-------------------------#
#   Probe Offsets         #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for bed probes. These frequently have calibrated offsets for xyz,
## and many will need them during setup. If you need to set these, just uncomment the following lines.
[probe]
pin: ~PC5
x_offset: 0
y_offset: 25.0
z_offset: 0

[controller_fan controller_fan]
fan_speed: 0.65
